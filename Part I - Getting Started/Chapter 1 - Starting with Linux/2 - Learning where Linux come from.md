# Learning where Linux come from

Some histories of Linux begin with [this msg](http://groups.google.com/group/comp.os.minix/msg/b813d52cbc5a044b?pli=1) posted by **Linus Torvald** to the *comp.os.minix* newsgroup on August 25, 1991

Minix was a UNIX-like OS that ran on PCs on early 1990s. Like Minix, Linux is also a clone of the UNIX OS. With few exceptions, such as Microfsoft Windows, most mordern computer systems (including Linux and Mac OS X) were derived from UNIX OSs, created orginally by AT&T

## The foundation of UNIX

- The UNIX filesystem.
- Input/Output Redirection.
- Portablilty

To make portability a reality, however, a high-level programming language was needed to implement the software needed. To that end, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie created the C programming language.
