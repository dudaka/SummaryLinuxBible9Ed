# Becoming Certified with Linux

If you are looking for a job as a Linux IT professional, often RHCSA or RHCE certification
is listed as a requirement or at least a preference for employers.

The RHCSA exam (EX200) provides the basic certification, covering such topics as configuring disks and filesystems, adding users, setting up a simple web and FTP server, and adding swap space.

The RHCE exam (EX300) tests for more advanced server configuration, as well an advanced knowledge of security features, such as SELinux and firewalls.

Red Hat gives an overview of how the exams work, as well as a list of topics you can expect to see covered in the exam. You can find those exam objectives on the following sites:

- [RHCSA](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/ex200-red-hat-certified-system-administrator-rhcsa-exam)
- [RHCE](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/ex300-red-hat-certified-engineer-rhce-exam)

If you plan to take the exams, check back to the exam objectives pages often, because they change from time to time. Keep in mind also that the RHCSA is a standalone certification; however, you must pass the RHCSA and the RHCE exams to get an RHCE certification. Often, the two exams are given on the same day.
