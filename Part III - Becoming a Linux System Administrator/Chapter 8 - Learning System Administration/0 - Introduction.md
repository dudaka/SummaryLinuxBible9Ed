# Introduction

Linux, like other UNIX-like systems, was intended for use by more than one person at a time.

Multiuser features enable many people to have accounts on a single Linux system, with their data kept secure from others.

Multitasking enables many people to run many programs on the computer at the same time, with each person able to run more than one program.

Sophisticated networking protocols and applications make it possible for a Linux system to extend its capabilities to network users and computers around the world.

**The person assigned to manage all of a Linux system’s resources is called the system administrator.**

To do most administrative tasks, you need to be logged in as the root user (also called the superuser) or to temporarily get root permission (usually using the sudo command).

Regular users who don’t have root permission cannot change, or in some cases even see, some of the configuration information for a Linux system.
