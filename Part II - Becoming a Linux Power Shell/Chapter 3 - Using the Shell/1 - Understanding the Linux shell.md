# Understanding the Linux shell

Before icons and windows took over computer screens you typed commands to interact with most computers. On UNIX systems, from which LINUX was derrived, the program used to interpret and manage commands was referred to as the *shell*.

No matter which Linux distribution you are using, you can always count on the fact that the shell is available to you. It provides a way to create executable script files, run programs, work with filesystems, compile computer code, and manage the computer.

Although the shell is less intuitive than common graphic user interfaces (GUIs), most Linux experts consider the shell to be much more powerful than GUIs. Shells have been around a long time, and many advanced features that aren't available from the desktop can be accessed by running shell commands.

The following are a few major reasons to learn how to use the shell:

- You will know how to get around any Linux or other UNIX-like system.
- Special shell features enable you to gather data input and direct data output between commands and the Linux filesystem.
- You can gather commands into a file using programming constructs such as conditional tests, loops, and case statements to quickly do complex operations that would be difficult to retype over and over.
