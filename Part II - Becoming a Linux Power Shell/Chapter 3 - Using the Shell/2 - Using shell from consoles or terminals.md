# Using shell from consoles or terminals

Therer are three most commons to get the shell interface in Linux:
- The shell prompt
- Terminal Window
- Virtual Console

## Using shell Prompt

If your Linux system has no graphical user interface, you will most likely see a shell prompt after you log in.

The default prompt for a regular user is simply a dollar sign $

The default prompt for the root user is a pound sign (also called a hash mark) #

## Using a terminal Window

## Using Virtual Consoles

Most Linux systems that include a desktop interface start multiple virtual consoles running on the computer. Virtual consoles are a way to have multiple shell sessions open at once in addition to the graphical interface you are using.
